I have referred the smart contract for creation of ERC20 token given in the link by appery.io. The link was: https://docs.appery.io/docs/eth-app-example-part1 . Then I did certain changes in the values that were given in the problem statement like totalsupply, symbol etc.
Eventually I added function like buyToken which was responsible for the Token Sale and then it included a function call to mint the tokens,though I forgot to include the openzeppelin repo for the minting code.
I also created an Escrow contract which was satisfies the second aspect of the problem statement partially. 
Till the extent I am aware I have completely executed the first three aspects that were asked in the problem statement, for the Smart Contract aspect of the problem. Though I can assure that with a bit more time I would have covered all the aspects including the UI part.
